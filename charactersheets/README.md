# Rolisteam Character Sheets
This repository is the collection of all the community-contributed character sheets that are available for use on Rolisteam. 

Contributing
============

If you want to help improve an existing sheet, just clone this repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request. If you would like to contribute a new sheet for the community to use, just clone this repository and create a new folder with the name of the game system that the sheet is for. Then send a pull request. If you have any questions or aren't familiar with Github or git in general, feel free to drop us a line on [the forum](http://forum.rolisteam.org) and we can help you get set up.

**Adding .rcs File**

When you are ready to submit your template for **public use**, create a Markdown file in your sheet's folder. Call it **README.md**. The file should have the following fields:

* `Authors`: A simple string telling who contributed toward the sheet (e.g. `John Smith`)
* `Contact`: A simple string describing how to contact you. You may give an email address, a nickname and the link on a forum, social network account whatever you want? 
* `Instructions`: Add any details needed to use your character sheet. If it does some computations, you may tell them.
* `Version`: You have to specify which version of rolisteam and RCSE you used for creating the charactersheet.
* `Licence`: Add the text of your licence. You are the author of the sheet. You have to decide how you share it.
* `Status`: Completed, WIP, draft

Guidelines
==========

Here are a few guidelines that you should follow when contributing sheets for the community:

**Make it Familiar**

The sheet for each game type should be familiar to players who are used to seeing the paper version of that sheet. It shouldn't be identical or violate any copyright, but it also shouldn't be laid out in such a crazy way that players will have a hard time understanding how to use it. **Design for ease of us first and foremost.** Along those lines, keep your UI changes simple -- please don't change the basic functionality of how a checkbox works, for example.

**Add Rolls**

The best sheets not only keep track of character stats, they have most of the rolls for the game system embedded in them. This makes it much easier for new players to play the game (just "click on that button on the sheet" versus "Make a macro, okay put slash roll one dee twenty..."). While you don't have to include every roll in the whole system, including the most common ones where appropriate can really help elevate your sheet to the next level.
